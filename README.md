# Sudoku Solver

This is a Sudoku solver implemented in Python. The solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to a given Sudoku puzzle.

# Sudoku Rules
Sudoku is a number puzzle played on a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9, such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

# Solver Algorithm
The solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution to a Sudoku puzzle. It systematically tries different numbers in empty cells and backtracks whenever a conflict is detected. The algorithm explores all possible combinations until a valid solution is found.
